# Heuristic Evaluations for John Hopkins CRC and Natural News
Based on Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design
## John Hopkins University of Medicine Coronavirus Resource Center
### Visibility of system status
The system successfully keeps users informed and in the loop of where they are in the site. For instance, based on whichever map the user is on (World vs. National vs. Critical Trends), the interface clearly displays on the top of the page which map they are exploring. Similarly, the site clearly highlights which page the user is on by highlighting the title of the page on the header/subheader, thereby allowing users to understand where they are on the site. Furthermore, the maps include information about when the statistics were last updated in order to keep the user in the loop on how recent the information is. 
### Match between system and the real world
The John Hopkins site does a great job at using everyday language when presenting COVID-19 information. Instead of using medical jargon, the site uses familiar terms such as "flattening the curve" and provides visual information (rather than lengthy, technical papers and articles) that describes the characteristics of COVID-19 and the development of the pandemic.Furthermore, on the testing information page, the site breaks down the technical testing process so that readers can understand what to expect from COVID-19 tests and the purpose behind them.
### User control and freedom
Users have full control over the site, and can easily go to previous pages by clicking the back arrow on the browser. Also, users can easily return to the home page by clicking the John Hopkins banner on the header. There are no pop ups or other distracting system functions that the user could accidently access.
### Consistency and standards
The site uses consistent labels and visual information to convey information so that users are not confused when navigating the website and can expect what they are going to find when clicking on buttons, titles, or maps.
### Error prevention
There are no pop ups or other distracting system functions that the user could accidently access.
### Recognition rather than recall
The unique map interface makes the site memorable and distinct. The site also uses familiar icons such as world and country maps to suggest the different maps available on the site without using text.
### Flexibility and efficiency of use
There are no accelorators on the website, but all of the information is clearly organized into categories such as maps, testing, tracing, and news so thaqt users can easily and efficiently locate information they are looking for. A search function could be added so that users can use keywords to quickly find the specific information they are looking for. 
### Aesthetic and minimalist design
The John Hopkins site is very professional and minimalistic. The site successfully condenses information into different categories and sub-categories and does not overwhelm users with too much information at once. One issue I found was on the maps, all of the statistics are presented at once on the screen which can overwhelm users, especially because there are a lot of numbers, graphs, and maps filling the screen. Furthermore, the user could be exposed to information that did not want or need to know, which could cause them to feel more stressed.

### Help and documentation
There is no help page available, or method to contact anyone behind the site.

## Natural News
### Visibility of system status
Unlike the John Hopkins site, Natural News does not clearly inform readers where they are in the site by highlighting the title of the page on the header. Moreover, they have the "Newsletter" header highlighted on all pages on the site, which could cause readers to falsely assume that they are on the newsletter page.
### Match between system and the real world
The text and titles of the articles on the Natural News website is over-aggressive with flashy messages written in capital letters such as, "AMERICA IS NOW A FAILED STATE," and "YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN." Instead of presenting information in a neutral manner, Natural News is oppinionated and passionately threatening, which can sway readers to believe and spread misinformation or cause them to feel stressed and anxious. This presents a large issue in information overload, as titles that target and frighten readers can impact their decision making. The material on Natural News is clearly propoganized and uncredible.
### User control and freedom
Users have control on this site in which they can use the back button on the browser heading to return to previous pages. And while clicking banner logo brings users back to the home page, the banner is sized and placed to look like an advertisement, which could cause readers to reluctantly click on it, thinking it might take them to another site. Also, there are other buttons on the header banner such as a subscription option which can be unclear for users. If they accidently click on this option, they are redirected to a separate subscription page. They can click out of this option by closing the tab on the browser, but there is no option within the site that allows them to exit from the system.
### Consistency and standards
On Natural News, there are a lot of links that users can click on to take them to different news sites similar to Natural News, some of which share the same articles. This can cause readers to be confused with the different news sites and overwhelmed with the amount of information and news presented to them from many different sources. Furthermore, right below the heading, there is large text highlighting one article titled, "AMERICA IS NOW A FAILED STATE." Since this does not match the same format as the other listed articles, it is unclear if this text is the website's main message and values, or if it is just a clickable article title.
### Error prevention
Natural news does not provide any error prevention when readers accidently click on one of the external links on the website or accidently clicks to make a subscription to the newsletter. Instead of checking on users and confirming that the user will be redirected to another page, the site immediately redirects the user to a completely different site.
### Recognition rather than recall
Natural News use social media icons to help users easily share information on different platforms. This site does not employ recogniton to condense the amount of information on the site, causing it to look generic and unmemorable.
### Flexibility and efficiency of use
There is a search function on the website and the articles are loosely organized into categories such as videos, latest news, and references. However, there are no other accelorators available on the site.
### Aesthetic and minimalist design
I believe this site intentionally clusters all of the information on the interface to cause readers to feel overwhelmed and click on the flashy article titles. The article titles are long and oppinionated and text is small and harf to read. 
### Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
Error messages are expressed in simple and plain language, but does not suggest any solutions.
### Help and documentation
There is no help available on the site. However, users can give Natural News feedback under specific guidelines.
